              Sochke is a technology and data-driven platform that enables
              citizens to connect with their area minister and minister’s work,
              experience and background.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sochke is a networking platform that enables users to connect with
              other users. And it's a digital platform that empowers citizens to
              contribute to their constituencies to make it a better place.
            </p>
            <p>We’ll make politics transparent for the citizens.</p>
            <p>
              We want to change the perspective of politics and make politics
              and minister work transparent and accessible every time for
              citizens. Instead of the minister's word, citizens will believe in
              data.
            </p>
            <p>
              And want to break the hidden wall between the common man and
              minister. Ministers should be accessible all the time.
            </p>
            <p>
              All of this makes India a more cohesive, participative and
              involved democracy.
            </p>
